### Game setup
 1. The game is played with 2 players (only).
 2. The board consists of 24 'Points', where the stones ca be placed.
 3. Each player has 9 Stones (black/white).
  
 ### How to play
 1. The Players set their stones alternating on one of the 'Points' until every stone is on the board
 2. The game is played by moving one stone each round per player and try to set a 'Mill' (3 Stones in a row)
 
 If a 'Mill' occured, this player can select a competitor stone and remove it from the game - This stone is not allowed to be in a 'Mill' itself.
 Exception: There are only 3 competitor stones available
 If 1 player has only 3 Stones left, he can 'jump' with his stones on every free 'Point' on the board
 
 3. The Player who has only 2 Stones or is not able to move at least 1 stone lost the game
